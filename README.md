# Full-Stack Next.js Application

## Project Description
During my journey with the [Next.js course](https://nextjs.org/learn/dashboard-app), I built a simplified version of a financial dashboard. This project is the culmination of learned skills and knowledge where I have implemented several practical web development areas using Next.js.

### Features:
- **Public Home Page:** The application features a publicly accessible homepage.
- **Login Page:** The application includes a login page, ensuring only authenticated access to the dashboard.
- **Protected Dashboard:** The dashboard is protected by authentication, leading to the display of user-specific information.
- **Invoice Management:** Users can add, edit, and delete invoices, thereby offering interactivity and dynamic data rendering.

Behind the scenes, a database was setup to support the functioning of the dashboard.

## What I Learned:
- **Styling & Optimizations:** I learned the different approaches to style a Next.js application and successfully optimized images, links, and fonts for better performance.
- **Routing & Fetching Data:** The course helped me to understand Next.js file-system routing, creating nested layouts and pages, and best practices for setting up a database on Vercel for fetching and streaming data.
- **Search & Pagination:** I implemented search and pagination functionalities using URL Search Params.
- **Mutating Data:** I gained practical knowledge of mutating data using React Server Actions and revalidated the Next.js cache accordingly.
- **Error Handling:** I learned to handle general and 404 not found errors effectively.
- **Server-Side Validation & Accessibility:** I implemented server-side form validation and learned techniques to improve the application's accessibility.
- **Authentication:** The application features authentication using NextAuth.js and Middleware, enabling secure access.
- **Metadata:** I understood the importance of adding metadata to prepare the application for social sharing.
